Without any option it can skip the stat() call, which can improve
the speed on slow filesystems.

'ls' and 'echo *' are not good from shell's view to work on files.
Even 'for a in *' often is slow, if you happen to hit zillons of files.
This is where dirlist can optimize things as it, by default, outputs
the directory listing unbuffered.

This is a companion to all other tools which can read a file list
from stdin.  Also there is an escape option to properly read filenames
with the shell read command.

Examples are given when you call it with option -h (help).
