Option -c added

<b>WARNING: This version still operates in unsafe mode!<b>
The description is already updated to upcomming version 0.5.0,
which fixes a possible race condition (however I am still
working on this fix).

With option -c you can define a directory where the backups are
created instead of the target directory.  It must be on the same
filesystem as source and destination.
