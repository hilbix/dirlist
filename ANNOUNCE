dirlist now has options -a -d -l -m -u -o, and accepts more than one directory

With options -a -l -m -u you can set which types of files are output with dirlist.
However this needs an additional stat() call per file.

With option -d you can debug this new feature.

With option -o you can terminate dirlist after the first successful argument.
The idea is, if you have a list of possibilities, the first one wins.
