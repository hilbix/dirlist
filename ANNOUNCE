Options -i and -z added, bugfix for -d

The bug which tried to list DIR/DIR on "dirlist -dr DIR" was removed.

You can now chain dirlist if called properly or read directories to read from stdin like this:

dirlist -s0 IMG | dirlist -0z | dirlist -z | wc -l

This counts the entries IMG/*/*/* without calls to stat().  And you will see errors if
IMG/* or IMG/*/* contains non-directories.
