Options -o and -p added

option -o is "original" behavior, such that <nobr>"mvatom file file
file dir/"</nobr> moves into directory.  However it must end in a /,
else it will not detect this case for safety.

option -p creates the missing directories in destinations.  Note that
option -r like in <nobr>"mvatom -rd the/dir path/to/file"</nobr>
already creates path/to in the/dir for file.  But it will not create
the/dir, for this you must give option -p (like in "mkdir -p").
