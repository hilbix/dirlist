Bugfix release and script cmpanddel.sh added

There was a long standing bug in option -p due to a bug in my library.
Previously only one level of missing upstream directories were
created.  However there was no other bad sideffect.

The new script cmpanddel.sh is nearly untested.  It is an old script
now changed to use mvatom.  Those changes have not been tested much
yet, the basic method is proven to work.
