Minor fix: Set SIGPIPE to standard behavior

For unknown reason I came across the problem, that SIGPIPE was ignored by default on a session.
I really do not know why this can happen, but apparently the SIGPIPE handling is not reset on exec(),
thus a wrong setting can be inherited from environments somehow.

Setting it explicitly to SIGDFL seems to fix this issue.

Also some examples given were improved.
