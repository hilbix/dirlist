Option -a added, "move away feature" fixed and renamed to option -ab,
dirlist now has some options

Option -a has less race conditions than option -b.  However the latest
moved file then does not keep it's original name if an elder file with
same name exists.

The "move away feature" had a bug in conjunction with option -s.  This
bug has been fixed.

The "move away feature" now needs both options -a and -b present to
work.  If these options are else used together, this is an error.

Dirlist now knows about a couple of options.
